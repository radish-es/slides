Covenants

## Agenda

1. Basics

3. Public Policy

### What is a covenant? 

A covenant is a promise that you will or will not do something in relation to your land.

<aside class="notes">

Compare covenants to public land-use control regimes. 

RCs have a long and often "hidden" role in structuring the social and economic fabric of local neighbourhoods, sometimes by building forms of discrimination directly into property rights and relationships

## *Tulk v Moxhay*

![](square.jpg)

<aside class="notes">

ASK: what is the basic legal problem in this case? 

- Enforcement of covenant against subsequent purchaser: contract to property

FACTS

- Tulk owns both an urban garden/park area—Leicester Square—and a number of houses bordering on the park. 

- Tulk sells the park to Elms under a restrictive covenant to keep the lot as a park. On the basis of contract, Elms is clearly bound by the terms of the covenant.

ASK: what are the specific terms of the covenent? (no development upkeep of fence and grounds) 

- Elms sells the square to Moxhay, the defendant. 

- Moxhay knew about the covenant, but did not consider themselves bound by it as a subsequent owner of the land. In direct violation of the covenant, Moxhay planned to develop the parklands. 

Issue: If Moxhay wasn't party to the original covenant, on what basis can its terms be enforced against him? 
 
- court in Tulk v Moxhay must identify a legal theory capable of transforming restrictive covenants from a "personal promise" into a "interest in land"—or at least, capable of having the same effect. 

- enforcement in EQUITY (focus on "notice") 

</aside>

### Transferring the Burdens 

1. Covenant must be negative in substance

2. Covenant must evidence an intention for the burden to run with the servient land.

3. Covenant must "touch and concern" (benefit) the dominant lands.

4. Purchaser of the servient lands has notice of the covenant. 

<aside class="notes">

Negative: capable of compliance by doing nothing

Intention: presumption against finding that covenant runs with the land -- intention to bind subsequent owners must be explicit

Touch and concern: affects (1) mode of occupation of the land or (2) directly affects the value (interpretation: restriction to certain uses but NOT restriction to certain class of owners -- see Noble v Alley) 

Notice: key equitable requirement from Tulk

NOTE: transferring the benefits is also possible = "annexation" (similar requirements except notice isn't necessary) 

</aside>

### Public Policy

*Re Drummond Wren* (1945, Ont HC)

*Noble and Wolf v Alley* (1951, SCC)

<aside class="notes">

Both deal with "racially restrictive covenants" -- long history of these in Canada and elsewhere as tools of discrimination/exclusion

ASK: how does the reasoning in these two cases differ? 

Drummond Wren: broad application of public policy doctrine (WWI context, domestic and int'll sources)

Noble:

- Kerwin/Rand: Tulk v Moxhay doesn't apply -- nothing in the covenant affecting use (doesn't touch and concern)
- Rand:  doesn't meet the #2 requirement (intention for burden to run with the land) -- just a contract re sale of land
- Estey: invalid restraint on alienation (part of public policy but much narrower) + "unclear" (maybe an element of #2) 

Locke (dissent): disagrees that court should look at touch and concern / annexation issues because these weren't before the trial judge

Consider a covenant placed on a vacant lot that requires any house constructed on the lot to be a minimum size (equivalent to a large single family home). Would such a covenant be valid? Why or why not?
