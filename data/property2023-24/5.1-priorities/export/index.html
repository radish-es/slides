Priorities and Registration

--

## Agenda

1.	Allocating the “risk of loss”
2.	Deeds registration
3.	Title registration
4.	Indefeasible title: the “curtain” principle
5.  The "mirror" principle

---

<small style="text-align: left;">

Assume that A owns the legal fee simple in Greenacre, the only proof of which is a title deed document that A keeps in their sock drawer. Now imagine that this title deed is stolen by some unknown person (call them B) and sold to C, who pays the thief $200,000 but has no knowledge of the theft.

Who should be entitled to ownership of the land? How would you justify your position? What additional info might be relevant?

#### Allocating the risk of loss

<aside class="notes">

LEVMORE:

- Fairness arguments not much help (both innocent)

- IDEA = “ALLOCATING RISK OF LOSS”

- Allocate loss to A = owner incentives to protect property

- Allocate loss to B = decides who to do business with, more opportunities to investigate shady behaviour or pedigree of title

- Allocate loss to A or B = who is the better insurer? (A can get theft insurance; B engages in more transactions so knows market better)

- Allocate loss to A or B = behaviour ex post … replaceable, etc

How would the **common law** resolve this problem according to the ***nemo dat* principle**?

### *Nemo dat quod non habet*

“One cannot confer on a transferee title that is greater than that held by the transferor.” (You can’t give what you don’t have)

<aside class="notes">

A holds title because B never had good legal title in the first place, so according to nemo dat B did not have anything to pass on to C.

ASK: What rationales does the “nemo dat” rule favour in this circumstance?

Places onus on C to investigate whether B had good title in the first place

Likely a result of the idea that with legal interests and written records, it is normally possible for C to carry out due diligence. The ND rule in these circumstances incentivizes C to do so.

### Deed Registration Systems

<aside class="notes">

History …

Medieval era, LIVERY OF SEISIN (state of title rests in the collective member of the local community … law as performance and ritual … documents confirm not constitute transfer)

Early modern: Literacy becoming more widespread among land owning classes = shift to documentary modes of transfer = deed itself now constitutes transfer of title

“Title search” becomes the main process of verifying good title = search through chain of documents held by the vendor (i.e. still an entirely PRIVATE system)

18th Century: move to keeping PUBLIC records of title docs = DEEDS registration system — but registration of docs remains voluntary, so never perfectly reflects the state of title … unregistered interests remain valid, so registry mainly serves function of reducing information/search costs

Until quite recently, this was the system in Nova Scotia

Main benefit of deed registration is therefore about making information about title more easy to access and search in a central repository … Registration affects buyer’s NOTICE of prior interests, but does itself say anything about the validity of those interests

Purchaser’s solicitor has role of finding and evaluating all documents on title affecting parcel in question; usually 40 years — this search must be done every time property sold, even if only a few years have intervened … so lots of duplicated effort

## Title Registration

- Curtain
- Mirror
- Net

<aside class="notes">

BASIC DIFFERENCE = “registration of title” vs “title by registration”

Main goals:

1. Provide CERTAINTY of title

2. SIMPLIFY land transactions and therefore reduce TRANSACTIONS COSTS (information costs, search costs, etc)

3. Provide a compensation mechanism for innocent parties who lose out if defect in title … also helps to increase the reliability of transactions

These re reflected in basic principles:

Curtain:  

- Registry “draws a curtain” between the registered interest and any prior interests, making the registered owner THE owner of title in the absence of fraud on that owner’s part

- Extent to which legislation fully reflects this ideal depends on whether system is one of DEFERRED or IMMEDIATE indefeasibility (explained in Lawrence v Wright)

Mirror:

- Going forward after registration, system reflects all relevant property interests at the present moment… so do not need to look elsewhere or do title searches to find out accurate state of title

- includes servitudes, leases (generally commercial), mortgages

Net: 

- If a property owner suffers loss because of an error on the record, compensation is provided by the government via an “assurance fund”

- Won’t cover in too much detail, but in general modern registration legislation sets out REASONS one might gain compensation (esp. where error in register or subject to fraud) and RESTRICTIONS that might bar one from gaining compensation.

### Curtain Principle

**Indefeasible title**: once registered, title to property cannot be lost, annulled or overturned by a prior defect in that title.

<aside class="notes">

Who does this principle favour (seller or buyer)?

- Answer: buyer = "dynamic security"

### *Lawrence v Wright*

![](lawrence.png)

<aside class="notes">

What happens if a property interest that would otherwise be void is accepted for registration AND subsequent purchasers rely on it in good faith and without notice of the defect?

Recall, definition of “indefeasible interest” is that it cannot be defeated by another claim.

Facts:

- Susan Lawrence owns the title to a house in Toronto; registered in Ontario’s torrens system

- Imposter posing as Lawrence retains lawyer to sell Lawrence’s home to Thomas Wright

- Wright then goes to Maple Trust Co. and gets a mortgage to fund purchase of the property.

- Fraudulent transfer of land in favour of Wright is registered in Ontario’s land Torrens registry and Maple Trust forwards the money to Wright; register’s its mortgage in the registry

- Wright takes the money and runs

- So, Maple Trust is claiming that it is entitled to rely on the registry in accordance with the mirror and curtain principles. Since it was innocent of the fraud its interest is valid.

- Lawrence is claiming that she was also innocent, and should therefore retain title to the land/house, free from the Maple Trust’s mortgage

ASK: why does the court reject Lawrence’s claim based on nemo dat?

- Lawrence says c/l rule applies: fraudster never had good title, so could not have passed anything to Wright, and Wright could not have passed anything to Maple Trust

- Court’s position is illustration of CONCEPTUAL SHIFT in theory of title under Torrens system … it is the registry itself that grants/creates valid title by way of registration, so nemo dat cannot have any application (i.e. registry can in fact grant title where none existed before)

</aside>

### Immediate Indefeasibility

![](immediate.png)

<aside class="notes">

Two theories: immediate vs deferred indefeasibility

Basically two options that turn on “what point in time” a registered interest actually becomes indefeasible under the curtain principle:

Immediate indefeasibility (Maple Trust’s argument)

- one’s interest becomes indefeasible at the moment it is registered, so long as done without fraud

- under this theory, Maple Trust, an innocent party, has an indefeasible interest as soon as they register their mortgage on title

- note that even under this theory Wright, the fraudster, never gains title to the land

</aside>

--

#### Deferred Indefeasibility

![](deferred.png)

<aside class="notes">

Deferred indefeasibility (Ontario’s argument)

- one’s interest becomes indefeasible only if one is “one step removed” from fraud

- here, Wright is fraudster and Maple Trust is the “intermediate owner” who takes interest from fraudster … does not get good title

- Next person who takes from Maple Trust gets indefeasible title because “one step removed”

- Based on the idea that, even though Maple Trust had no notice of the fraud, was still in a “special position” to discover the fraud because dealt directly with Wright, the fraudster

COURT:

- Decides in favour of deferred indefeasibility:

- equally plausible interpretations of Ontario’s legislation … but legislative history reveals that amendment supporting “immediate indefeasibility” theory was a minor one (so doesn’t support a major shift in this aspect of the system)

- policy = (i) homeowner has “special attachment” to property, whereas Maple Trust is just a business … therefore MT better compensated by assurance fund

- policy = (ii) homeowner has NO chance to avoid the fraud; MT has some chance, even though did due diligence

#### *Land Registration Act*, SNS 2001, c 6-2

<small style="text-align: left;">

35 (6) In determining whether it is just and equitable to confirm the registration objected to, the court shall consider

(a) the nature of the ownership and the use of the parcel by the parties;

(b) the circumstances of the registration;

(c) the special characteristics of the parcel and their significance to the parties;

(d) the willingness of any of the parties to receive compensation in lieu of an interest in the parcel;

(e) the ease with which the amount of compensation for a loss may be determined; and

(f) any other circumstances that, in the opinion of the court, are relevant to its determination.

</small>

<aside class="notes">

ASK: How might Lawrence v Wright be decided differently under the governing legislative regime in Nova Scotia — particularly under section 35 of the Land Registration Act?

As in Ontario, no specific provision in LRA identifying whether NS follows immediate or deferred indefeasibility

Generally thought to be a system of deferred indefeasibility, but section 35 is unique b/c it afford the courts broad discretion to apply theory of immediate indefeasibility (i.e. “confirm the registration objected to”) based on a number of factors laid out in section 35(6)

ASK: while this would seem to be a more flexible system, does it go too far to undermine the certainty that land registries are supposed to provide?

#### Note re Adverse Possession and Prescription

<aside class="notes">

Under section 74-75 of Nova Scotia’s Land Registration Act, still possible to claim adverse possession and easements by prescription against registered owner — however these rights have been significantly limited.

Example of legislature’s attempts to balance priorities under land registry system (in favour of purchasers) against interests of those with right arising from long use/occupation.
