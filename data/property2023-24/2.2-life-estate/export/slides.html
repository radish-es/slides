--

### What do B and C hold?

X grants: "To A for life, then to B for life, then to C"

--

## Doctrine of Waste

How to prevent the life tenant from depleting the value of the estate (recall *Ellickson*)?

## Interpretation and Construction

--

## A Puzzle

### *Re Walker* (1924)

> “I give and devise unto my said wife all my real and personal property ... and also should any portion of my estate still remain in the hands of my said wife at the time of her decease undisposed of by her, such remainder shall be divided as follows ...”

<aside class="notes">

- attempt to "accomplish that which is impossible"
- guiding principle: ascertain the dominant and subordinate intention of the testator
- two options: (1) fee simple with repugnant gift over or (2) life estate with gift over (mentions third option but doesn't consider)
- but how to ascertain these intentions? "undisposed of" doesn't refer to a testamentary disposition by Walker's wife but instead a disposition during her lifetime. So this is an attempt to deal with what wife didn't use during her lifetime out of what the court presumes is a fee simple based on the "plain" words of the will.

### *Re Taylor* (1982)

> “I give, devise and bequeath all my real and personal estate of which I die possessed to my wife Kate ... to have and use during her lifetime ... Any estate of which she may be possessed at the time of her death is to be divided equally between my daughters ...”

<aside class="notes">

- court interprets this language as creating a life estate
- so what's the problem? "Any estate of which she may be possessed..." seems to imply that Kate could go beyond doctrine of waste and use the life estate as if it were a fee simple
- so court needs a further interpretation = life estate + "power to encroach on the capital for her own proper maintenance" 
- court rejects argument by those claiming under Kate's will that LE + PtE = Fee simple. 
- court also rejects argument that attempt to gift over "what remains" at Kate's death operates to actually vest Kate with a fee simple (and simultaneously makes any attempt to give a gift over after a fee simple a repugnancy) 
- Why does this matter? Practical (who gets the property at the end of the day) and formal (firm commitment to distinguishing between estates; can't create new types) 
- court falls back on "intention of the testator" (But is this really so clear, viewed from the lay perspective?)

### *Christensen v Martini Estate* (1999) 

> “I give to my wife ... 2203 31 Ave ... for her use. When she no longer needs 2203 31 Ave. ... that she give said property to Sandra and Sonya  ...”

<aside class="notes">

Possible interpretations?

- lower court: "for her use" is too uncertain, so Sandra and Sonya get a fee simple outright
- ABCA: Martini gets a life estate, with a gift over to Sandra and Sonya -- court bases its conclusion on "intention of the testator from the will AND all the surrounding circumstances" = testator intended to benefit BOTH Martini and the Christensens 

Other options?

- fee simple to Martini (the other words being mere expressions of what the testator hopes might happen when Martini dies"
- fee simple to Sandra and Sonya with a "licence" in Martini to occupy 
- "conditional" fee simple to Martini (condition being that when she no longer needs it...)
